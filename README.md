# Observer Design Pattern

## Running the code
    - Clone the repository
    - run `npm i` in the repository folder
    - now you can run:
        - `npm run observer` to test the observer design pattern
        - `npm run noObserver` to test the solution without using the pattern

## Explanation

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (the Subject)
maintains a list of observers that are automatically notified whenever its state changes.
This establishes a dependency relationship, allowing the Subject to inform observers
about updates without directly knowing them.
